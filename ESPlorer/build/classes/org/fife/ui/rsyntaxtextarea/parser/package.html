	Interfaces for parsing text in RSyntaxTextAreas and identifying errors,
	warnings, etc.  Implementations of the <code>Parser</code>  interface
	are notified when the document has been modified, so they can add
	squiggle-underline markers to instances of RSTA to signify code errors and
	other important snippets.
